It helps you write cleaner code for network requests by treating errors as values, instead of exceptions. Network Response NetworkResponse<S, E> is a Kotlin sealed class with the following states: Success: Represents successful responses (2xx response codes) ServerError: Represents Server errors NetworkError: Represents connectivity errors UnknownError: Represents every other kind of error which can not be classified as an API error or a network problem (eg JSON deserialization exceptions) It is generic on two types: a response ( S ), and an error ( E ). The response type is your Java/Kotlin representation of the API response, while the error type represents the error response sent by the API. Example data class DetailsResponse ( val details : String ) data class DetailsError ( val errorMessage : String ) interface Api { @Get ( \"/details\" ) suspend fun details (): NetworkResponse < DetailsResponse , DetailsError > } class ViewModel { suspend fun fetchDetails () { when ( val response = api . details ()) { is NetworkResponse . Success -> handleSuccess ( response . body ) is NetworkResponse . ServerError -> handleServerError ( response . code ) is NetworkResponse . NetworkError -> handleNetworkError ( response . error ) is NetworkResponse . UnknownError -> handleUnknownError ( response . error ) } } } Installation Add the Jitpack repository to your list of repositories: allprojects { repositories { maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } } } Then add the dependency in your gradle file: dependencies { implementation \"com.github.haroldadmin:NetworkResponseAdapter:(latest-version)\" } And finally, register NetworkResponseAdapter with Retrofit: val retrofit = Retrofit .

This library helps you deal with scenarios where you can successfully recover from errors, and extract meaningful information from them too! NetworkResponseAdapter provides a much cleaner solution than Retrofit's built in Call type for dealing with errors. Call throws an exception on any kind of an error, leaving it up to you to catch it and parse it manually to figure out what went wrong. NetworkResponseAdapter does all of that for you and returns the result in an easily consumable NetworkResponse subtype. The RxJava retrofit adapter treats non 2xx response codes as errors, which seems silly in the context of Rx where errors terminate streams. Also, just like the Call<T> type, it makes you deal with all types of errors in an onError callback, where you have to manually parse it to find out exactly what went wrong. Using the Response class provided by Retrofit is cumbersome, as you have to manually parse error bodies with it.","title":"Benefits"},{"location":"benefits/#benefits","text":"Modelling errors as a part of your state is a recommended practice.

However, not all responses need JSON objects as sometimes primitive string suffice. To support a wide variety of response types, Retrofit supports adding custom converters. One such converter is the Scalars Converter which can handle primitive response types. To use it, use a primitive as your response type: interface Api { @GET ( \"/details\" ) suspend fun details (): NetworkResponse < String , String > } And then make sure that the Scalars converter is added to Retrofit before the JSON converter: val retrofit = Retrofit .

These fields are populated if their values can be extract from a failed request. data class UnknownError ( val error : Throwable , val code : Int? = null , val headers : Headers? = null , ) : NetworkResponse < Nothing , Nothing > () It is possible to extract this information from a failed request in most cases.
